- The Dockerfile `FROM` instruction specifies the base image for the new image you're building.

- The Dockerfile `RUN` instruction lets you to run commands inside the image during a build. Each `RUN` instruction adds a new layer to the overall image.

- The Dockerfile `COPY` instruction adds files into the image as a new layer.

- The Dockerfile `EXPOSE` instruction documents the network port an application uses.

- The Dockerfile `ENTRYPOINT` instruction sets the default application to run when the image is started as a container.
